                    <p>For this section of the Milestone, We turned our Mockups from the previous milestone into Prototypes using Figma. The mockups we prototyped were the ones selected for part C of Milestone 3 as they were the ones we agreed was the best
                        fit for our problem of study. For more Informaion, see Part A.2 of <a href="./milestone3.html#MS3_A">Milestone 3</a>

                    <p>For Prototype 1, the goal was to add a menu for the user to use that would hold all the relevant information about formatting and dealing with images in Google Docs. When the user clicks on an image, the dropdown menu will appear and
                        will give the user access to many different options. For this specific prototype, we had the user's goal be to rotate the image using the added dropdown menu. By adding this menu, we are accomplishing our overall goal of making
                        using images in Google Docs simpler. Having a dropdown menu that only requires two mouse clicks to accomplish this goal is much much simpler than the current way in Google Docs. On top of this, dropdown menus are a simple and user-friendly
                        way to organize a UI for both novice and advanced users <sup><a class="inline-citation-number" id="sup1" href="#source1" title="The 4 Golden Rules of UI Design" >[1]</a></sup>.

                    <p>For Prototype 3, the goal of the prototype was to include a new menu on Google Docs that would allow users more options to format and deal with images in in the interface. In order to use the dropdown menu called “Annotations”, the
                        user must first select the image that they wish to annotate. After selecting the image, the user can then press the “Annotations” tab in the dropdown menu and will be shown several different options for formatting the image. For
                        this specific prototype, the user wishes to add text to their image using the “Annotations” menu which is then allowed by pressing the “Text” button. This will allow users to include and place text wherever they wish layered on
                        top of the image that they selected. Through this menu, annotating text onto images that users want to edit becomes much easier and accessible than Google Docs by only having to make two clicks.

                    <!-- Part B -->
                    <h2 class="section-heading">B. Testing Protocol</h2> <br>
                    <p>The leading research question that drove the user testing protocol for revisions on Google Docs is “Do our proposed changes to Google Doc’s system of adding, creating, and editing images and tables allow for a more efficient and streamlined
                        user experience?”. Essentially, our group implemented functionalities for relevant user stories as alternative design solutions to various problems we identified existing in the current Google Docs editor. Therefore, it was necessary
                        to allocate methodologies in order to test our solutions. We chose “Participant Observation” as one method to effectively test our procedures for our design prototypes. Participant observation provides a deeper understanding of
                        the dynamic between users and our updated Google Docs system by closely observing the response users have to the new additions. Secondly, using surveys will help strengthen research by providing concrete feedback users have on
                        the Google Docs system. Using observational and participant study methodologies are important as it “provides researchers with unique opportunities to explore the study informants’ unanticipated types of behavior or activities”
                        <sup><a class="inline-citation-number" id="sup2" href="#source2" title="Challenges of Introducing Participant Observation to Community Health Research" >[2]</a></sup>. Furthermore this “allows researchers to investigate these types
                        of behavior or activities and reframe the research questions with a deeper understanding of the research problem” <sup><a class="inline-citation-number" href="#source2" title="Challenges of Introducing Participant Observation to Community Health Research" >[2]</a></sup>.
                        Essentially, measuring user satisfaction with our prototypes can be sufficiently measured due to the advantageous insight in the participant’s behaviors.
                    </p>
                    <p>In order to test our research question, we will conduct two surveys and an observational experiment to find out if our proposed changes to Google Doc’s system might lead to a more efficient and streamlined user experience. All the
                        information that we would need to collect could be done so through the safety of the internet using platforms like Google Forms, Zoom, and other collaborative platforms to help us communicate with the participants. First, we will
                        get the consent of participants in the study. This can be assured by starting off with a pre-observation survey that will contain a disclaimer that informs any participants of what they will be required to do and what information
                        they will share and how it will be used. The pre-observation survey will then ask participants about Google Docs and their experience and views of the system.
                    </p>
                    <p>There will be multiple pieces of data that will be sought. The time it takes to complete the task as well as the number of steps, user satisfaction/frustration/expectations, measure if the task was completed (if at all), and a user
                        rating of which system/method they preferred. The users will time themselves with a start/stop timer during the task. The number of steps will be calculated later by watching the recording of the user’s interactions with each system.
                        The rest of the information will be collected through the use of an online survey like Google Forms. All of the information recorded in the survey will then be stored in an Excel sheet to organize all of the data according to the
                        different categories of data we are collecting.
                    </p>
                    <p>Afterward, the participants will get to try using both Google Docs and our proposed system at two different intervals. While using both systems, participants will be timed and asked to complete three different tasks using either system.
                        Tasks will be assigned to the participants by prompting users to use the added functionality in the above prototypes. Potentially, users could be utilizing the added Formatting tab, utilizing the added canvas option that allows
                        for live drawing within the document, or simply testing the ability to annotate, draw, or add text on existing images in the document.
                    </p>
                    <p>After completing the tasks, the participants will fill out a post-observation survey in which they will share their own emotional responses and analysis of the observation as well as how they feel about either of the systems. Our data
                        will then be analyzed according to several different factors regarding each of the tasks in order to better predict which system (Google Docs or our proposed system) provides a better user experience. For the numerical data (time
                        to complete, number of steps, completed/not completed), we would do a statistical analysis of the control group (regular google docs) and our experimental group (our proposed changes) to test for a statistically significant decrease
                        in time and steps to complete. For the participants’ emotional response (User satisfaction/frustration/expectations, which version they preferred), we will analyze their responses in a user perception survey to see which version
                        has a higher mean satisfaction rate. These results will, if our proposed changes are better, reinforce our view and give us the statistical answer to our research question.

                    <!-- <p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center
                        because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.</p>
                    <p>Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.</p>
                    <p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.</p>
                    <p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.</p>
                    <p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those
                        which divide us.</p>

                    <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

                    <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched
                        it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

                    <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>
                    <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
