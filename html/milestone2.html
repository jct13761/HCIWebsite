                    <!-- <h2 class="section-heading">Revised Problem Statement</h2> -->
                    <p>Google Docs for student note-taking is not the most friendly and usable interface. Specifically, the ability to take notes from multiple users and draw or insert diagrams easily into the document is not very effective. Our definition
                        of friendly is the average user’s ability to effectively interact with the interface without hindrance to their objective. Our problem is focused on Google Drive because it allows for a cross-platform solution for note-taking for
                        multiple users and devices simultaneously. It is also the most popular note-taking platform by far. Another common note-taking app, Notability, does not allow for multiple users to take notes on the same document. Microsoft’s solution,
                        OneNote and OneDrive, is not as simple as Google Docs and as a result, doesn't have as much traffic as Google Docs. Other note-taking options, like paper and pencil, cannot be shared realistically with other users simultaneously
                        and, while it does allow for easy drawing, does not have the benefits of an online solution (copy-and-paste, backups, sharing, etc.) Taking notes simultaneously on Google Docs can lead to a clunky user experience, especially if
                        the users are taking notes around the same area of the document. Page formatting can be messed up, users can be jarringly shifted down pages, and latency delays can lead to multiple people typing the same sentence because they
                        did not know the other one was typing. The result of these can lead to one person doing the majority of typing while the others watch to avoid causing more issues. Diagram features are lacking because it does not allow users to
                        format diagrams easily without messing up the page’s text among other formatting. It also does not support any on-screen drawing from a touch-screen device, like an iPad with an apple pencil. This hindrance is further compounded
                        for non-touchscreen devices which require the user to use a clunky insertion and creation of diagrams. We think that these issues can apply to every user of Google Docs, but our focus is mainly on students and instructors in in-person
                        classes. These lacking features can lead to students missing notes and information due to the clunkiness of Google Docs or an instructor not being able to draw a quick diagram on the projector to illustrate an idea to the class.
                        Factors that contribute to our problem are self-efficacy and information recall, as students may be discouraged from using the app to avoid the problems listed above.

                    <!-- <p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center
                        because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.</p>
                    <p>Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.</p>
                    <p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.</p>
                    <p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.</p>
                    <p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those
                        which divide us.</p> -->

                    <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched
