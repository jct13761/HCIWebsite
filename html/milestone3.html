                    <!-- Part A -->
                    <h2 class="section-heading">A. User Experience Requirements</h2>
                    <br>
                    <h4>A.1: User Stories</h4>
                    <p>Our group generated user stories relevant to our topic. We created several, and then chose the three that were most relevant to our problem. </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> <span>As a note-taker, I want to be able to insert an image so that I can visualize the contents of my notes.</span> </li>
                        <li><b><span>As a note-taker, I want to be able to annotate an image without having to use another app.</span></b></li>
                        <li> <span>As a note-taker, I want to format text and images together in order to organize my notes.</span> </li>
                        <li><b><span>As a note-taker, I want to be able to draw an image without having to open another window.</span></b></li>
                        <li> <span>As a note-taker, I want to be able to collaborate with other students on a document in order to work in groups.</span> </li>
                        <li><b><span>As a note-taker, I want to be able to quickly insert an image and format it using the signifiers in the toolbar.</span></b></li>
                        <li> <span>As an instructor, I want to be able to properly display my notes in order to lecture in a face-to-face setting and provide editable notes.</span> </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>A.2: Top User Stories</h4>
                    <p> After generating these user stories, we chose the three that were most relevant to our problem. They are as follows:</p>

                    <p><b>1) As a note-taker, I want to be able to annotate an image without having to use another app.</b></p>
                    <p>This story is relevant to our solution by allowing the user to make edits to an already inserted image. If they simply wanted to highlight a portion of the image or draw an arrow to something, they should not need to be directed to
                        another application or window in order to do this. Having some button or keybinding to allow for quick edits to existing images or tables would improve the efficiency and affordances of Google Docs.
                    </p>

                    <p><b>2) As a note-taker, I want to be able to draw an image without having to open another window.</b></p>
                    <p>The improvements to the UI from this story would allow users to draw diagrams or tables in their notes while keeping their notes in the foreground of the application. If users were able to draw an image on top of or next to their typed
                        notes, this would increase their efficiency in the fast-paced environment of a face-to-face classroom.
                    </p>

                    <p><b>3) As a note-taker, I want to be able to quickly insert an image and format it using the signifiers in the toolbar.</b></p>
                    <p>This story is relevant to our solution because it covers the improvement to the signifiers of google docs. Improving the signifiers and shortening the number of steps a user would have to take in order to accomplish these tasks would
                        accomplish our goal of an improved user experience while taking notes with google docs.
                    </p>

                    <h4>B.1: Ideation</h4>
                    <p>For this step, we had an ideation session in which we all generated ways to address the issues in the selected user stories. For this activity, we used Mural. </p>
                    <p>Here is the <a href="https://app.mural.co/t/hcitermprojectmilestone33258/m/hcitermprojectmilestone33258/1634578348224/2f7b0393282f39ed8fc8875b63176bcf274378f1?sender=u444a929540c22a3b46a95085">link</a> to the mural page used for this

                    <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched
                        it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

                    <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
